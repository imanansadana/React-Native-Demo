This is a React Native Project setup with Expo.

To run it you'll need to install a Virtual Device, I've optimised it just for iOS so use Xcode.

First you need to install the Expo CLI
npm i -g expo-cli

Then you need to install the dependencies with
expo install

Then you can run the project using this command
npm start

This will start the Metro Bundler, and you can run the app in the virtual device from the browser window that will open up.
